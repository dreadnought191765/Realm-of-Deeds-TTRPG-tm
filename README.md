ROD or Realm of Deeds is a custom TTRPG I am making, currently as a hobby but I may publish it one day in the future (well, technically it is published here, so hey-ho).

It is fantasy in nature, with some influence from a lot of different systems and ideas I have created.

Realm of Deedsâ„¢ is a trademark of myself, all rights reserved. 




Feel free to use it if you want to run a campaign or look at sytems. If you use any of it for yourself, and intend on publishing it, give credit plez (and if somehow you take stuff and publish it as paid (I am sure there are better things out there to have) reach out to me first.
